# RavenConvert
RavenConvert is a Python library to convert stuff if you are too lazy to convert stuff like Celsium to Fahrenheit.
It has different functions - each acts as a converter from one unit to another.
A good example of how it works would be - converting weeks to years. Or in reverse, years to weeks. In code, it would be like:

import RavenConvert as rc # Importing the library RavenConvert, for simpliness, as "rc"

convertion = rc.convertYW(7) # Converting seven years to weeks
print(convertion) # Printing the result of the variable "convertion"

There are different units that you can convert! Enjoy!
(Note: there will be future updates later, it's not finished)
